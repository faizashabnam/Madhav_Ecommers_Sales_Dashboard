# Madhav_Ecommers_Sales_Dashboard
I developed an interactive sales dashboard to analyze e-commerce metrics,revealing sales, profit, and items sold with a average order value. Clothing accounted for 63% of items sold, and Printers and Bookcases drove profits. Built using Power BI, it helps businesses identify trends, optimize strategies, and make data-driven decisions.
